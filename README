NAME
    List::Objects::Types - Type::Tiny-based types for
    List::Objects::WithUtils

SYNOPSIS
      package Foo;

      use List::Objects::Types -all;
      use List::Objects::WithUtils;
      use Moo;

      has my_array => (
        is  => 'ro',
        isa => ArrayObj,
        default => sub { array }
      );

      has my_hash => (
        is  => 'ro',
        isa => HashObj,
        default => sub { hash }
      );

      has static_array => (
        is  => 'ro',
        isa => ImmutableArray,
        default => sub { immarray(qw/ foo bar /) }
      );

DESCRIPTION
    A small set of Type::Tiny-based types & coercions.

    Also see MoopsX::ListObjects, which provides Moops class-building sugar
    with List::Objects::WithUtils integration.

   ArrayObj
    An object that consumes List::Objects::WithUtils::Role::Array.

    Can be coerced from a plain ARRAY; a shallow copy is performed.

   HashObj
    An object that consumes List::Objects::WithUtils::Role::Hash.

    Can be coerced from a plain HASH; a shallow copy is performed.

   ImmutableArray
    An object that isa List::Objects::WithUtils::Array::Immutable.

    Can be coerced from a plain ARRAY or an "ArrayObj"; a shallow copy is
    performed.

   TypedArray
    An object that isa List::Objects::WithUtils::Array::Typed.

    Not coercible.

   TypedArray[`a]
    TypedArray can be parameterized with another type constraint. For
    example, the type constraint "TypedArray[Num]" will accept
    "array_of(Num, 1, 2, 3.14159)", and will also accept "array_of(Int, 1,
    2, 3)" because "Int" is a subtype of "Num".

    Can be coerced from a plain ARRAY or an "ArrayObj"; a shallow copy is
    performed. If the parameter also has a coercion, this will be applied to
    each item in the new array.
